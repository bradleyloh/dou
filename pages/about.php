            He first discovered his passion of creating food while making exam welfare ice creams for his hallmates. He sees the joy in producing different kinds of
            ice creams which includes his signature matcha, almond and chocolate flavours.

        <p>Dou! started off as Jeremy was volunteering at Cambodia, Anlong Veng. As a form of gratitude from the locals, he was given the opportunity to taste naturally grown beans.
          <br>
          </br>
          He realised the beans were much stronger in it's smell and taste than any beans he had ever tasted! It was then he started off experimenting
          natural beans to fit into the local hawker culture.  
          <br>
          </br>
          "I'm not defined by my gpa!" quips Chef Jeremy Sim, as he strongly held on to his beliefs that
          life is about pursuing what you truly love.
